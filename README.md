# NFTMarketplace

This application is a marketplace to buy and sell NFTs. Logic is implemented in the smart contact Market.sol

It is a Hardhat based project connected to Presto using the "leopardwest" network

## Use scenario
A user logs in (using their wallet) to the marketplace where they have a "Market" page and a "My collection" page. 
- On "Market" page the user can see all the available NFTs on the market and buy them. Once an NFT is bought by the user, it goes to a user privateNFT collection
- On "My collection" page the user can see their own NFTs and sell them by setting the price for the market and putting an NFT on the market

The user scenario has been simulated and tested on the platform [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)
