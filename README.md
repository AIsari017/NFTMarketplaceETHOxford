## Intro
Decentralisation is coming to a new stage of power and scalability

And we shall embrace the prospects it brings
## Project
This application is a marketplace to buy, store and sell NFTs

It is a Hardhat based project connected to Presto using the "leopardwest" network and deployed on Gateway software

## How to use
The deployed fully functional project is available on the platform: https://leopardwest-blockscout.eu-north-2.gateway.fm/ 

Connect your wallet on the website and select the "leopardwest" network on your account

Follow the [link](https://leopardwest-faucet.eu-north-2.gateway.fm/) to request 1 ETH on this network (paste your account address in the input field)

On the above-mentioned [platform](https://leopardwest-blockscout.eu-north-2.gateway.fm) now explore the functionality of the contract (Read and Write sections). You will be able to:
- Add a new NFT to the marketplace or to your own collection
- View your NFTs, set a price and put on a market a chosen NFT
